**Business Intelligence**\
I mainly work on the development and management of BI projects, both for reporting (mainly SAP BO 4.2; Qlikview 11.2 and 12, occasionally PowerBI and MicroStrategy) and for the design of Data Warehouses and Integration Systems in Oracle, SqlServer, or Vertica environments, as well as for the installation and configuration of Qlikview Server/Publisher 11.2. 
I possess strong skills in identifying, analyzing, and solving technical and architectural issues, with excellent knowledge of major RDBMS Sql (Oracle11g-21c/SqlServer/DuckDB) and NoSql (MongoDB); 

I use SSIS, Semarchy xDI, Talend Cloud, Mulesoft Anypoint Platform, and Boomi integration platforms; I have also had the opportunity to evaluate and explore Alterix Designer. In addition to these, we use our custom ELT integration and scheduling platform that performs transformations by customizing them on Oracle or SqlServer in PL/SQL or T-SQL, maximizing achievable performance. I am a certified Boomi Administrator, both as an Associate Administrator and Professional Linux Operational Administrator.

I regularly use Git/GitHub for versioning the implementations of the projects I manage, and TFS if already used by clients.

**Full Stack Web Architect**\
I have over ten years of experience in architectural design and implementation of web applications on the ExtJS framework with various backends. Over the years, I have used different languages, including PHP, JSP, C#, and Javascript, along with several databases, including document-based ones, such as Oracle, SqlServer, SqlLite, and MongoDB. Currently, I use a full-stack JavaScript structure with Node.js backend, also in a microservices architecture.
Current interest: using the gRPC framework for communication between Node.js microservices in an architecture based on API Gateway and authentication/authorization with JWT tokens.

**DevOps**\
I have good knowledge of virtualizing Linux or Windows nodes and experience in designing Docker Containers managed with Docker-Compose and Kubernetes Clusters on multiple virtual Linux nodes. I designed a Microk8s cluster in HA on Ubuntu virtual nodes, with MongoDB configured in Sharding/ReplicaSet on the k8s cluster, used for implementing and configuring applications on autoscaling pods, consisting internally of multiple containers. 
I currently use Oracle19c and 23c databases released on Docker. 
I have implemented some CI/CD pipelines (for containerized apps) with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, and a CD pipeline related to PL/SQL/Oracle activities on Jenkins for automatic release in the development/integration environment via webhooks.

Work Experience
---------------------

2018-2024 (current)  
:   **Senior Consultant & Project Coordinator @Binnovation**

:   After the merger of Softquattro into Binnovation, I have been collaborating with them since March 2018 as a Senior Consultant in the BI field. I continued to follow the client in the GDO sector, managing activities related to Application Management (AM) and development projects along the entire pipeline, from preparing offers to functional and technical analysis, all the way through implementations and final releases.

    * For AM ticket management, I developed a full-stack JavaScript webapp, and for collecting receipt data from stores, I designed a set of web services in Node.js, using a MongoDB buffer to translate JSON documents and transfer the data to the final Oracle DWH.
    * In recent years, I implemented a source code management system based on git/github, introduced the use of Docker containers, and proposed Kubernetes clusters for managing receipt web services.
    * I initiated the migration of the web interface for the custom ELT DWMS integration system from a JSP platform to a full-stack JavaScript ExtJs/Node.js platform.

:   At Binnovation, I have also worked on other clients in the following areas:

    * Retail client, managing the data warehouse and related activities, based on a SqlServer and SSIS environment
    * GDO client, managing the receipt-based data warehouse implemented on a Vertica database with a data integration system using the Stambia Data Integration platform (later Semarchy XDi)
    * Insurance client, managing the QlikSense feed repository, based on a data warehouse in DataVault 2.0 model and dimensional data marts, with data integration through SSIS and TFS

2006-2018  
:   **Senior Analyst & Project Coordinator @Softquattro**

:   I worked at Softquattro from September 2005 to February 2018, initially as a Junior BI Consultant and later as a Senior Consultant/Analyst in Business Intelligence.

    * From 2005 to 2008, I managed a DWH for a client in the oil&gas sector, while also introducing the first AJAX technologies into several internal web applications. 
    * From 2009 onwards, I began working with a GDO client, handling the evolution of the supply chain DWH and commercial control DWH, introducing the datamart interface with Hyperion Planning, and the reporting system based on Business Objects (from v.XI to v.4.0). I also implemented a webapp for managing end-of-day cash sheets and an invoice management webapp, still in use, based on the ExtJS framework with JSP application server and business logic in PL/SQL.
    * Over the years, I have also worked with clients in the automotive, retail, and banking sectors, mainly focusing on implementing reporting based on QlikView with data integration platforms implemented using SqlServer Integration Services (SSIS).
    * Over time, I expanded my skills by also managing the client relationship, taking on the role of project coordinator/PM for the preparation of offers, related technical and functional analysis, and coordination of resources allocated to those projects or AM activities.

2000-2005  
:   **Analyst Programmer @PIC Servizi per l'informatica**

:   I worked at PIC from October 2000 to August 2005, first as a Junior Programmer and later as an Analyst Programmer, allocated to various clients in telecom, energy, and banking sectors, working on software development using C/C++/PLSQL on client-server applications initially and web applications later (in C# and ASP.NET)
