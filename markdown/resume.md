**Business Intelligence**I am primarily involved in the development and management of BI projects, both in terms of reporting (mainly SAP BO 4.2; Qlikview 11.2 and 12, occasionally PowerBI and MicroStrategy) and in the design of Data Warehouses and Integration Systems in Oracle, SqlServer, or Vertica environments, as well as the installation and configuration of Qlikview Server/Publisher 11.2.
I have excellent skills in identifying, analyzing, and resolving technical and architectural issues, along with a strong knowledge of major RDBMS systems (Oracle 11g-21c/SqlServer/DuckDB) and NoSQL (MongoDB).

I use integration platforms such as SSIS, Semarchy xDI, Talend Cloud, Mulesoft Anypoint Platform, and Boomi. I have also evaluated and explored Alterix Designer. Additionally, we use our own ELT integration and scheduling platform, which customizes transformations on Oracle or SqlServer in PL/SQL or T-SQL to maximize performance. I am certified as both a Boomi Associate Administrator and a Professional Linux Operational Administrator.

I regularly use Git/GitHub for project versioning and TFS when required by clients.

**Full Stack Web Architect**I have over a decade of experience in architectural design and implementation of web applications on the ExtJS framework with various back-ends. Over the years, I have used multiple languages, including PHP, JSP, C#, and JavaScript, alongside various databases, including document-oriented ones like Oracle, SqlServer, SqlLite, and MongoDB. Currently, I employ a full-stack JavaScript structure with a Node.js backend, even in microservices architecture.

Current interest: utilizing the gRPC framework for communication between Node.js microservices in an API Gateway-based architecture, with authentication/authorization via JWT tokens.

**DevOps**I have solid knowledge of Linux or Windows node virtualization and experience in designing Docker Containers managed with Docker-Compose and Kubernetes clusters across multiple virtual Linux nodes. I designed a Microk8s HA cluster on Ubuntu virtual nodes, with a MongoDB Sharding/ReplicaSet configuration on the k8s cluster, used for deploying and configuring applications in autoscaling pods composed of multiple containers.

I currently use Oracle 19c and 23c databases released on Docker.

I have implemented some CI/CD pipelines (for containerized apps) with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, as well as a CD pipeline for PL/SQL/Oracle activities using Jenkins for automatic deployment in development/integration environments via webhook.

**Education**1990-1998:   **Degree in Electronic Engineering – Microelectronics Specialization**; Politecnico di Milano – Faculty of Engineering

**Work Experience**2018-2024 (ongoing):   **Senior Consultant & Project Coordinator @Binnovation**

    Following the merger of Softquattro into Binnovation, I have been collaborating with the latter since March 2018 as a Senior Consultant in the BI field.
    I continued to work primarily with the retail client I was already handling at Softquattro, managing AM activities and those related to evolutionary projects across the entire supply chain, from preparing offers to functional and technical analysis, implementations, and final releases.

    - For managing AM tickets, I developed a full-stack JavaScript web app, and for acquiring receipt flow from sales points, I designed a set of Node.js web services, using a MongoDB buffer to translate data from JSON documents to the final Oracle DWH.
    - In recent years, I implemented a source code management system based on Git/GitHub, introduced the use of Docker containers, and proposed using Kubernetes clusters for managing receipt web services.
    - I initiated the migration of the custom DWMS ELT integration system's web interface from a JSP platform to a full-stack JavaScript ExtJS/Node.js.

    Additionally, I also engaged in activities for other clients, including:
    - Retail client: managing the data warehouse and associated activities based on a SqlServer and SSIS environment.
    - Retail client: managing a receipt data warehouse implemented on Vertica DB with a data integration system based on the Stambia Data Integration platform (later acquired by Semarchy XDi).
    - Insurance client: managing the QlikSense feeding repository, based on a DataVault 2 data warehouse and dimensional data marts, with data integration via SSIS and TFS.

2006-2018:   **Senior Analyst & Project Coordinator @Softquattro**

    - From 2005 to 2008, I managed a DWH at an oil & gas client, introducing the first AJAX technologies into several internal web apps.
    - From 2009 onward, I began supporting a retail client, handling the evolution of the supply chain DWH and the commercial control DWH, introducing the datamart interface environment for Hyperion Planning and a reporting system based on Business Objects (from v.XI to v.4.0). 
    - I also implemented a web app for end-of-day cash register management and another for invoice management, still in use today, based on the ExtJS framework on JSP application server and PL/SQL business logic.

2000-2005:   **Analyst Programmer @PIC Servizi per l'Informatica**

    I worked at PIC from October 2000 to August 2005, initially as a junior programmer and later as an Analyst Programmer, allocated to various clients mainly in telecom, energy, and banking fields, dealing with software development activities using C/C++/PLSQL for client-server applications initially, and later web applications (in C# and ASP.NET).

**Technical Expertise**Databases:    - Proficient in configuring and using Oracle (versions 9.2 onward), including on Docker containers or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.    - Skilled in SqlServer (versions 2005 onward) and MongoDB (version 3.6 onward, including cloud Atlas version).    - Experience with Vertica DB, MySQL, SQLite (used as embedded repositories for web apps), and analytical embedded DuckDB.
